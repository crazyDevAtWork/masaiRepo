Hello Masai, this is Nilutpal Bezbaruah. I am a student of your Fweb27 full time batch. I joined Masai almost 3 weeks ago as of today. At the beginning it was easy. I was feeling self-accomplished, as I was able to complete the tasks given out by you. But lately, the learning curve has gone steep and it is difficult to keep up with
this 'marathon disguished everday 400 m'. I am putting no offense. If one wants to be a web developer in 8 months, one needs to go through this harsh routine. And then
there will be someone among you guys delivering motivatoinal speeches, which really helps boost my self-esteem. Even if my day was bad, I kind of re-energies to do much better tomorrow. Thank you Masai!!.
